WOMEN SAFETY ANALYTICS – LEO: EMPOWERING PROTECTION THROUGH SMART TECHNOLOGY

LEO is an advanced AI-driven women safety software designed to provide instant emergency response using multi-trigger activation methods. The system allows users to trigger distress alerts by shaking the phone, pressing the power button multiple times, or using a voice command such as "Help me." Upon activation, LEO automatically notifies the nearest police station and registered emergency contacts while sharing the victim's real-time GPS location.

To strengthen legal protection, LEO incorporates automated evidence collection, capturing the attacker’s images, voice recordings, and video footage using OpenCV-based video processing. Additionally, an AI-powered voice warning emits a loud alert to deter attackers. The software is optimized for low-battery mode, ensuring functionality via SMS and USSD codes when the internet is unavailable.

Built on a robust tech stack, LEO integrates Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based speech recognition, OpenCV for real-time video processing, and Twilio, WhatsApp API, and SMTP for emergency alerts. The backend is powered by Node.js with REST API for seamless data handling and secure communication. The system also ensures end-to-end encryption to maintain user privacy and prevent data misuse.

Looking ahead, LEO plans to implement AI-based threat detection, a deep fake police call feature to intimidate attackers, offline SOS functionality, and integration with smart glasses and IoT devices. The software aims to collaborate with government agencies and NGOs to enhance public safety and law enforcement coordination.

LEO is more than just an application—it's a movement towards a safer society, empowering women with real-time protection, legal proof collection, and a hands-free emergency response system.
